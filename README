TALESF is a C library for identifying potential binding sites for transcription
activator-like (TAL) effectors in a given genomic sequence. Compiling and
running this program requires a C compiler with OpenMP support (such as GCC 4.2
or higher). To compile TALESF, enter the following commands in the directory
containing this file.

  make
  make install

By default, the output data is sorted by genomic position.The 'sortfilter' script
is provided as a tool for (surprise!) sorting and filtering output from TALESF.
For a descriptive usage statement, enter the following command.

  ./sortfilter -h
